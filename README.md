## Name_Surname_Web_Wroc≈Çaw

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- React
- HTML/CSS
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)

## Approach

1. Created a React application with TypeScript for type safety
2. Implemented four main pages/components:
   - Product List
   - Shopping Cart
   - Order Summary
   - Order Confirmation (as a separate HTML page)
3. Used React state management for the shopping cart functionality
4. Implemented proper routing between views
5. Added localStorage to persist order data for the confirmation page

## Assumptions

- The confirmation page is a separate HTML page as required
- The cart state is maintained in memory and cleared after order placement
- Basic styling is provided but not the focus (as per requirements)

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
